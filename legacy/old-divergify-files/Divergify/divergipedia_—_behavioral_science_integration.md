## How Divergipedia Organizes Knowledge

Divergipedia is your ADHD encyclopedia — built on behavioral influence research, designed to hack your brain for productivity. Every entry uses principles from behavioral psychology (attention hijacking, open loops, micro-commitments, environmental cues) to help you actually get shit done. This isn't self-help fluff — it's weaponized neuroscience for chaos brains.

Think of this as your field manual for productivity domination.

---

## A

### Admin Alley

**n.** A small, predictable daily window reserved exclusively for the soul-crushing tasks you've been avoiding: emails, bills, forms, insurance paperwork, the mortgage refinance you started three months ago. Admin Alley corrals all the boring adult garbage into one containment zone so it doesn't leak into your creative hours. You're not procrastinating — you're scheduling strategically. Set it for 15–30 minutes, ideally at a low-energy time of day when you weren't going to write the Great American Novel anyway, and knock out two things maximum. The goal isn't to finish everything; it's to prove the pile isn't infinite.

**Behavioral principle:** *Environmental cue design* — by creating a dedicated time-space anchor for admin work, you reduce decision fatigue and eliminate the constant low-level dread that comes from having undone tasks floating around your mental workspace.

---

### Almost There Alert

**n.** A notification that fires when Divergify detects you're about 80% through a task — the exact moment when most ADHD brains lose interest and wander off to start something new. Almost There Alert gives you the nudge: "You're so close. Finish this one thing." It's the difference between 47 half-done projects and actually crossing a finish line. The alert is calibrated to catch you before the dopamine crashes but after you've done enough work that quitting now would be tragic.

**Behavioral principle:** *Attention hijacking at critical drop-off points* — intervention timing is everything. By interrupting at the 80% mark (when motivation naturally wanes), the system redirects focus before momentum is lost.

---

### Anchor Task

**n.** The one task that, if completed, stabilizes your entire day — even if everything else falls apart. Anchor Task isn't necessarily the biggest or hardest task; it's the one that prevents the day from feeling like a total wash. It might be "send that one email," "do 10 minutes of the priority project," or "take a shower." On good days, Anchor Task is your launchpad. On rough days, it's your lifeline. Divergify surfaces your Anchor Task early and protects it from being buried under 47 smaller fires.

**Behavioral principle:** *Single-point commitment strategy* — by reducing the "successful day" definition to ONE achievable action, you eliminate the paralysis that comes from overwhelming task lists.

---

## B

### Beat your baseline

**n.** A daily streak system where you race against *yourself* — not perfection, not other people, just your previous performance. Beat your baseline tracks how long tasks take you and creates a personal record to chase. Did one small thing faster today? You're ahead. On a 3-day improvement streak? The dopamine system celebrates. This eliminates shame (you're only competing with past-you) while maintaining the motivational benefit of gamification.

**Behavioral principle:** *Variable reward timing + self-anchored comparison* — instead of external standards (which trigger shame in ADHD brains), you compete only with your historical performance, creating sustainable motivation loops.

---

### Body Budget

**n.** A framework for tracking sensory, social, and cognitive spending across a day or week. Every interaction, task, and environment costs something — and ADHD/autistic brains often overspend without realizing it. Body Budget helps you see where your energy is going: Did that 30-minute meeting actually cost you two hours of recovery? Is the open office draining your sensory budget before lunch? Once you know your spending patterns, you can plan around them instead of crashing every Wednesday at 2 PM.

**Behavioral principle:** *Resource awareness through pattern tracking* — most people don't realize their energy drains until they track them. Body Budget makes the invisible visible.

---

### Brain Battery

**n.** Your subjective energy gauge — the metric that determines what kind of tasks you can handle right now. Brain Battery isn't about hours of sleep or caffeine intake; it's about how much capacity you actually have in this moment. Divergify tracks Brain Battery throughout the day and uses it to power appropriate nudges, suggest breaks, and prevent you from scheduling Deep Thought Work during your 3 PM crash. When Brain Battery is low, the system shifts into Comfort Quest mode instead of demanding heroics.

**Behavioral principle:** *State-based task matching* — assigning tasks based on current capacity (not willpower) reduces failure and builds sustainable productivity patterns.

---

## C

### Chaos Control

**n.** The central dashboard for dopamine, deadlines, and detours. Chaos Control is your mission control — the one place where all the moving parts of your day, week, and brain converge. It shows you what's urgent, what's optional, what's draining you, and what's giving you life. Chaos Control doesn't eliminate chaos (impossible); it helps you navigate it with intention instead of panic.

**Behavioral principle:** *Single-source-of-truth design* — cognitive load increases exponentially when information is scattered. Chaos Control reduces mental overhead by centralizing decision-making.

---

### Compassion Mode

**n.** A language and metrics setting that actively removes shame from the productivity equation. Compassion Mode reframes "failure" as "data" and replaces punitive nudges with curious ones. Instead of "You're behind schedule," it says, "What made this hard today?" Metrics emphasize learning, patterns, and effort rather than perfect completion rates. Compassion Mode is the difference between a system that motivates you and one that makes you want to throw your phone into the ocean.

**Behavioral principle:** *Shame-elimination via reframing* — shame kills motivation in ADHD brains faster than anything else. By removing judgment language, Compassion Mode keeps the feedback loop open.

---

### Context Cache

**n.** An autosave system that captures the key facts, links, and mental state you'll need to pick up a task later without reloading your entire brain. Context Cache prevents the dreaded "Wait, why was I doing this again?" moment. When you pause a task, Divergify saves: what you were working on, what the next step is, what you were thinking, and where the relevant files live. When you return, you're not starting from scratch — you're resuming mid-sentence.

**Behavioral principle:** *Cognitive state preservation* — context-switching costs are brutal for ADHD brains. Context Cache minimizes re-entry friction by preserving mental breadcrumbs.

---

## E

### Ellipsis Effect

**n.** The psychological pull created by leaving something *almost* finished — a cliffhanger for your brain. Your nervous system hates incomplete patterns and will obsess over finishing them. Ellipsis Effect leverages this by never showing you the full task list at once. Instead, you see your current step + a *hint* of what's next ("Step 3: Write intro... Next: ???"). This creates a completion drive that pulls you forward without overwhelming you with the full mountain.

**Behavioral principle:** *Open loop psychology* — unfinished tasks create cognitive tension (the Zeigarnik effect). By strategically revealing tasks in sequence, Divergify harnesses this tension as motivation fuel.

---

## F

### F.E.A.R. Framework

**n.** A self-brainwashing system adapted from behavioral influence research: **Focus** (make goals unavoidable via environmental cues), **Emotion** (anchor tasks to feelings/consequences), **Agitation** (create productive urgency), **Repetition** (constant exposure until automatic). F.E.A.R. turns tasks into behavior patterns by hitting your nervous system from multiple angles. Example: Your Anchor Task appears on your lock screen (Focus), you've defined why it matters (Emotion), you see the cost of delay (Agitation), and you get varied reminders every 20 minutes (Repetition).

**Behavioral principle:** *Multi-vector behavior installation* — single interventions fail. F.E.A.R. compounds influence by layering environmental, emotional, and repetitive triggers.

---

### Fractuation

**n.** The art of breaking overwhelming tasks into 2-5 minute micro-steps so tiny your brain can't justify avoiding them. Fractuation eliminates "I don't know where to start" paralysis by defining the absolute smallest next action. Instead of "Write blog post," Fractuation gives you: 1) Open Google Docs, 2) Write one bad sentence, 3) Write two more bad sentences. Each step is so small it feels ridiculous — which is exactly why it works.

**Behavioral principle:** *Micro-commitment ladder* — large commitments trigger resistance. By reducing the first step to something laughably easy, Fractuation bypasses the brain's "too hard" filter and gets you moving.

## G

### Gremlin Mode

![Mischievous Gremlin Representing ADHD Chaos Energy](file_id:690010dad70f79069a21b553)

**n.** The chaotic, impulsive, mischievous energy that shows up when your ADHD brain is understimulated, overwhelmed, or just done with the day. Gremlin Mode isn't bad — it's your nervous system's way of demanding novelty, play, or chaos. Instead of fighting it, Divergify redirects it: give the Gremlin a task. Examples: reorganize a drawer violently, delete 47 old emails with reckless abandon, doodle something ridiculous, or start a new project you'll abandon in 20 minutes (and that's fine). Gremlin Mode gets a voice in Divergify so you're not constantly at war with your own brain.

**Behavioral principle:** *Impulse redirection vs. suppression* — resisting Gremlin energy burns willpower. Channeling it into (semi-)productive chaos satisfies the novelty craving without derailing your day.

---

### Guilt Guillotine

**n.** A tool that severs the connection between past failure and future effort. Guilt Guillotine says: what happened yesterday (or last week, or last year) does not determine what you can do today. You're not behind — you're starting now. Guilt Guillotine is especially powerful for chronic procrastinators who spend more time hating themselves than actually working. Divergify uses Guilt Guillotine language to reframe: "You didn't do it then. You can do it now. That's the whole game."

**Behavioral principle:** *Temporal decoupling* — shame about past inaction creates learned helplessness. By actively severing that connection, Guilt Guillotine restores agency.

---

## H

### Habit Trance Mode

**n.** A daily repetition system that brainwashes you into automatic behaviors using hypnotic language patterns. You set a habit you want to install (e.g., "work out daily") and a specific time. Every day at that time, Divergify sends a short notification with consistent, identity-reinforcing messaging: "You're the kind of person who works out. You've done it before. Today's the day you already started." After 21+ days of this repetitive messaging, the behavior starts feeling automatic — not because you have willpower, but because you've been linguistically conditioned.

**Behavioral principle:** *Identity priming through repetition* — behavior change is easier when framed as identity ("I am someone who...") rather than action ("I should..."). Habit Trance Mode uses daily repetition to install the identity first.

---

### Hyperfocus Tunnel

![Person Lost in Deep Hyperfocus](file_id:68f1ffca0ad07b9a7442f114)

**n.** The immersive, time-warping state where you're so absorbed in a task that hours vanish, meals are forgotten, and the world ceases to exist. Hyperfocus Tunnel is a double-edged sword: incredibly productive but often uncontrollable and unsustainable. Divergify doesn't try to force Hyperfocus Tunnel — it just helps you notice when you're in it and gently reminds you to hydrate, move, and breathe. It also helps you identify what triggers Hyperfocus so you can occasionally harness it intentionally.

**Behavioral principle:** *State awareness without intervention* — forcing state changes during hyperfocus backfires. Instead, Divergify tracks patterns to help you recognize and occasionally invoke the state deliberately.

---

## M

### Momentum Thief

**n.** Anything that breaks your rhythm and makes restarting feel impossible. Common Momentum Thieves: unclear next actions, missing tools, sensory overload, emotional dysregulation, and other people's urgency. Divergify identifies Momentum Thieves via Friction Hunts and Interruption Logs, then helps you neutralize them before they steal your day.

**Behavioral principle:** *Friction point identification* — most productivity loss comes from invisible friction. By naming and tracking Momentum Thieves, you can systematically eliminate them.

---

## P

### Perfectionism Parachute

![Parachute Catching Someone Falling from Perfectionism](file_id:690010d928226fc61b4f3150)

**n.** An emergency system that catches you before perfectionism spirals into total paralysis. Perfectionism Parachute activates when Divergify detects you've been "working" on something for an unusually long time without progress (a sign you're stuck in perfectionism quicksand). It intervenes with permission statements: "Done is better than perfect," "Shitty first drafts are required," "You can fix it later." The Parachute doesn't shame you for caring about quality — it just reminds you that forward motion beats frozen perfection.

**Behavioral principle:** *Intervention at cognitive distortion points* — perfectionism is a cognitive trap that masquerades as high standards. Early intervention prevents the trap from closing.

---

### Procrastiplanning

![Person Surrounded by Planning Tools Instead of Doing Work](file_id:68f1fa07c7644c2c474ac75c)

**n.** The ADHD specialty of spending hours meticulously planning something instead of actually doing it. You tell yourself you're "being productive" because you're making color-coded spreadsheets, researching the optimal system, or reorganizing your task manager for the 47th time — but zero actual work gets done. Procrastiplanning *feels* like progress while being pure avoidance. Divergify calls this out when it sees you spending more time organizing tasks than completing them: "You've reorganized this list 3 times today. Pick ONE thing and do it. Now."

**Behavioral principle:** *Meta-work awareness* — planning is seductive because it feels productive without risk. Divergify flags when planning becomes avoidance.

---

## T

### Task Mountain

![Overwhelming Mountain of Tasks Looming Over Someone](file_id:68f200cb0ad07b9a7442f37b)

**n.** The overwhelming, impossible-looking pile of tasks that makes you want to crawl back into bed and declare the day a loss before it even starts. Task Mountain triggers freeze mode in ADHD brains — everything feels equally urgent and insurmountable, so you do nothing. Divergify fights Task Mountain with Fractuation (breaking it into micro-steps), Anchor Task (picking the ONE thing that matters), and Ellipsis Effect (hiding the full mountain and showing only the current step). The mountain doesn't shrink — but your view of it changes.

**Behavioral principle:** *Overwhelm reduction through controlled information exposure* — seeing everything at once triggers paralysis. By controlling what you see (and when), Divergify prevents freeze response.

---

### Taskache

![Person with Head Made of Sticky Notes](file_id:68f1f3500ad07b9a7442d416)

**n.** The headache-like sensation that comes from having too many tasks bouncing around your brain with nowhere to land. Taskache happens when your working memory is overloaded with mental sticky notes, creating a low-level background stress that makes *everything* harder. The cure isn't completing the tasks — it's *capturing* them out of your head and into a trusted system (like Divergify). Once tasks are externalized, the Taskache fades, even if the work isn't done yet.

**Behavioral principle:** *Cognitive offloading* — working memory is limited. Externalizing tasks into a reliable system frees mental RAM for actual thinking.

---

### Tin Foil Hat Mode

**n.** Divergify's privacy-first, zero-tracking operating mode. In Tin Foil Hat Mode, all your data stays on YOUR device — no servers, no cloud sync, no analytics, no selling your ADHD patterns to advertisers. Your tasks, habits, and productivity data are yours alone. Tin Foil Hat Mode is the default because we assume you don't want your brain data harvested by corpo overlords.

**Behavioral principle:** *Trust through transparency* — neurodivergent users (especially those with trauma/PTSD) need to know their data is safe. Tin Foil Hat Mode removes surveillance anxiety.

## Additional Entries (Continued Alphabetically)

### Urgency Engineering

**n.** The deliberate creation of productive time pressure to trigger action without real consequences. Urgency Engineering uses artificial deadlines, countdown timers, and cost-of-delay visualizations to activate your brain's urgency response — but in a controlled, non-threatening way. Example: "You have 15 minutes before your brain crashes. What's the ONE thing?" The urgency is real enough to trigger focus, but not so real it causes panic.

**Behavioral principle:** *Controlled stress response activation* — ADHD brains often need urgency to initiate. Urgency Engineering provides that spark without requiring actual crisis.

---

### Variable Reward System

**n.** A gamification mechanic that delivers dopamine hits at *unpredictable* intervals — the same psychological mechanism that makes slot machines addictive, but used for good. Instead of getting the same "good job!" every time you complete a task, Variable Reward System mixes up the rewards: sometimes you get a simple checkmark, sometimes a confetti animation, sometimes a hilarious Gremlin voice line. The unpredictability keeps your brain engaged because it never knows when the next dopamine spike is coming.

**Behavioral principle:** *Intermittent reinforcement* — unpredictable rewards are more motivating than consistent ones. Variable Reward System leverages this to maintain long-term engagement.

---

### Zero Day Prevention

**n.** A system designed to prevent "zero days" — days where you complete literally nothing and spiral into shame. Zero Day Prevention doesn't demand productivity; it just asks for *one* micro-action, no matter how small: drink water, reply to one text, move three things from floor to shelf. The bar is set so low that refusal would be absurd. Zero Day Prevention protects your streak and preserves your sense of agency, even on the worst days.

**Behavioral principle:** *Minimum viable action* — progress, no matter how small, prevents learned helplessness. One action keeps the streak alive and the identity intact.
