# Divergify Brand Guide
_Last updated: 2025-10-04 19:59_

## Core Idea
Divergify helps neurodivergent brains **turn chaos into momentum**. We treat difference as an advantage.

## Mission (short)
**Arm the beautifully-distractible with tools, language, and community to build the lives they were told they couldn’t.**

## Mission (long, website-ready)
We’re building practical, privacy-first tools for ADHD and neurodivergent brains: to manage mental traffic, turn sparks into shipped work, and treat energy like the precious, creative fuel it is. We honor autonomy, dignity, and humor. We aim to be sustainable, then generous: once Divergify is stable, excess supports community projects and mutual aid.

## Values
- **No shame, no fluff.** Pragmatic, funny, relentlessly human.
- **Privacy-first.** “Tin Foil Hat Mode” is a feature, not a meme.
- **Momentum over perfection.** Ship small. Iterate.
- **Accessibility.** Plain language. Low-friction flows.
- **Evidence + Lived experience.** Both matter.

## Tone & Voice
- Friendly, blunt, witty. Light profanity OK in our own channels; keep it clean externally.
- Speak like a smart friend who gets it.
- Avoid pity and medicalized condescension.

## Logo Use
- Place logo on dark backgrounds (Gunmetal/Charcoal) or on gradients with enough contrast.
- Padding: at least ½ the brain icon width on all sides.
- Don’t distort, tilt, or add drop shadows to the logo.

## Taglines
- “For brains that zig when the world zags.”
- “Rerouting genius on detour.”
- “Beat your baseline.”

## Imagery
- Clean geometry, thin lines, subtle neon glow. Avoid busy/childish visuals.
- Use conceptual, witty metaphors (lane lines, compasses, traffic flow, bubbles).
