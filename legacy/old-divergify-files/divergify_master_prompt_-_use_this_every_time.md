## THE CORE - NEVER FORGET THIS

**Divergify** is a neurodivergent-first productivity ecosystem. We're not fixing broken brains—we're building a bridge for FUTURE brains living in an outdated world.

### The Philosophy
- Neurodivergence = evolutionary upgrade, not disability
- The world runs on outdated "Windows 95" thinking
- Our brains are "next-gen OS" 
- We need a buffer/translator to thrive until the world catches up
- We use **Chase Hughes behavioral science methods** to help users "self-brainwash" into positive habits naturally

### The Mission
Build tools that treat ADHD/neurodivergent brains as the default, not the exception. Make productivity feel like breathing, not drowning.
