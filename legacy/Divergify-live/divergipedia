## How Divergipedia Organizes Knowledge

Divergipedia is your ADHD field manual — built on behavioral influence research, designed to hack your brain's resistance to productivity. Every entry uses principles from neuroscience and behavioral psychology (attention control, open loops, micro-commitments, environmental conditioning) to help you actually get shit done. This isn't self-help fluff — it's applied cognitive science for chaos brains.

Each term is alphabetized and includes the behavioral principle it's built on.

---

## A

### Admin Alley

**n.** A small, predictable daily window reserved exclusively for the soul-crushing tasks you've been avoiding: emails, bills, forms, insurance paperwork, the mortgage refinance you started three months ago. Admin Alley corrals all the boring adult garbage into one containment zone so it doesn't leak into your creative hours. Set it for 15–30 minutes, ideally at a low-energy time of day, and knock out two things maximum. The goal isn't to finish everything; it's to prove the pile isn't infinite.

**Behavioral principle:** *Environmental cue design + time-boxing*

---

### Almost There Alert

**n.** A notification that fires when you're about 80% through a task — the exact moment when most ADHD brains lose interest and wander off. Almost There Alert catches you before the dopamine crashes: "You're so close. Finish this one thing." It's calibrated to intervene at the critical drop-off point.

**Behavioral principle:** *Attention hijacking at momentum loss threshold*

---

### AM Rehearsal

**n.** A quick mental run-through in the morning where you preview the day's major events, transitions, and potential chaos points. This isn't about planning every minute; it's about reducing surprises. ADHD brains hate surprise context switches. AM Rehearsal gives your nervous system a heads-up so you're not emotionally ambushed by a 2 PM dentist appointment you forgot existed.

**Behavioral principle:** *Predictive anxiety reduction*

---

### Anchor Music

**n.** A specific playlist, album, or song that becomes your Pavlovian "it's time to work" cue. Anchor Music trains your nervous system to recognize the start of a focus session without requiring willpower. The key is consistency — use the same music every time, and your brain starts settling in before the first chorus.

**Behavioral principle:** *Auditory conditioning anchor*

---

### Anchor Task

**n.** The one task that, if completed, stabilizes your entire day — even if everything else falls apart. Anchor Task isn't necessarily the biggest or hardest task; it's the one that prevents the day from feeling like a total wash. On good days, it's your launchpad. On rough days, it's your lifeline.

**Behavioral principle:** *Single-point commitment strategy*

---

### Attention Altitude

**n.** A 30,000-foot view of your day, energy levels, and priorities — the strategic perspective that helps you see the forest instead of getting lost in the trees. Attention Altitude pulls you out of reactive mode and asks: What actually matters today? What can wait? What's draining my brain battery?

**Behavioral principle:** *Cognitive distancing for decision clarity*

---

### Auto Triage

**n.** Divergify's system for sorting incoming tasks into three buckets: **Now** (do it today), **Next** (soon, but not urgent), and **Nursery** (interesting idea, wrong season). Auto Triage removes the cognitive load of constantly re-evaluating what's important.

**Behavioral principle:** *Decision automation via pre-set criteria*

---

### Avoidance Alarm

**n.** A detection system that notices when you're spending more time organizing, researching, or "preparing" than actually doing. Avoidance Alarm flags meta-work masquerading as productivity and redirects: "You've reorganized this list 3 times. Pick ONE thing and do it."

**Behavioral principle:** *Meta-work awareness + pattern interruption*

---

## B

### Beat your baseline

**n.** A daily streak system where you race against yourself — not perfection, not other people, just your previous performance. Beat your baseline tracks how long tasks take you and creates a personal record to chase. Did one thing faster today? You're ahead. On a 3-day improvement streak? Dopamine celebration.

**Behavioral principle:** *Self-anchored competition + variable reward timing*

---

### Bias Bouncer

**n.** A built-in reality check that catches catastrophic thinking and tests it against actual data. When your brain spirals — "I'm failing at everything" — Bias Bouncer steps in: *Is that true, or is that anxiety talking?* It pulls up recent wins and evidence that contradicts the doom spiral.

**Behavioral principle:** *Cognitive distortion intervention*

---

### Body Budget

**n.** A framework for tracking sensory, social, and cognitive spending across a day or week. Every interaction, task, and environment costs something — and ADHD/autistic brains often overspend without realizing it. Body Budget makes energy drains visible so you can plan around them.

**Behavioral principle:** *Resource awareness through pattern tracking*

---

### Body Double Ping

**n.** A gentle virtual nudge that mimics the effect of having someone sit with you while you work. Body Double Ping reminds you that you're not alone, even if you're physically solo. Divergify can pair you with a real accountability buddy or simulate the effect with timed check-ins.

**Behavioral principle:** *Social presence effect (real or simulated)*

---

### Boredom Alarm

**n.** A cue that triggers variety before your brain rebels from monotony. Boredom Alarm recognizes when you've been doing the same type of work for too long and suggests a switch: move your body, change locations, swap to a different task type.

**Behavioral principle:** *Novelty demand management*

---

### Brain Battery

**n.** Your subjective energy gauge — the metric that determines what kind of tasks you can handle right now. Divergify tracks Brain Battery throughout the day and uses it to suggest appropriate tasks, breaks, and protective strategies. When Brain Battery is low, the system shifts into Comfort Quest mode.

**Behavioral principle:** *State-based task matching*

---

### Breadcrumb Protocol

**n.** A system for leaving context markers before switching tasks so you can find your way back. Before an interruption, Breadcrumb Protocol prompts: "Drop a note so you can return." It captures: what you were doing, what comes next, and where the relevant files live.

**Behavioral principle:** *Cognitive state preservation*

---

## C

### Cascade Method

**n.** The practice of breaking overwhelming tasks into 2-5 minute micro-steps so tiny your brain can't justify avoiding them. Cascade Method eliminates "I don't know where to start" paralysis. Instead of "Write blog post," you get: 1) Open Google Docs, 2) Write one bad sentence, 3) Write two more.

**Behavioral principle:** *Micro-commitment ladder + resistance bypass*

---

### Chaos Control

**n.** The central dashboard for dopamine, deadlines, and detours. Chaos Control is mission control — where all the moving parts of your day converge. It shows you what's urgent, what's optional, what's draining you, and what's giving you life.

**Behavioral principle:** *Single-source-of-truth design*

---

### Checkpoint Cheer

**n.** Micro-celebration at key intervals to reinforce progress without overwhelming your nervous system. Checkpoint Cheer might be a quiet ding, a small animation, or a single line of encouragement. You finished a section? Cheer. You made it through a hard task? Cheer.

**Behavioral principle:** *Intermittent positive reinforcement*

---

### Cliffhanger Mechanism

**n.** The psychological pull created by leaving something *almost* finished — a cliffhanger for your brain. Your nervous system hates incomplete patterns. Cliffhanger Mechanism never shows you the full task list at once. Instead, you see your current step + a hint of what's next: "Step 3: Write intro... Next: ???"

**Behavioral principle:** *Open loop psychology (Zeigarnik effect)*

---

### Cognitive Drag

**n.** The invisible sludge that makes starting hard even when you "know" what to do. Cognitive Drag includes: unclear instructions, missing tools, environmental friction, decision fatigue, and emotional weight. Divergify reduces drag via Setup Macros and Friction Hunts.

**Behavioral principle:** *Friction point identification + elimination*

---

### Comfort Quest

**n.** A single, gentle task designed for days when motivation is near zero. Comfort Quest isn't about productivity; it's about proving you're still functional. Tasks might include: water a plant, reply to one text, put on real pants. Comfort Quest prevents zero days.

**Behavioral principle:** *Minimum viable action*

---

### Compassion Mode

**n.** A language and metrics setting that removes shame from productivity. Compassion Mode reframes "failure" as "data" and replaces punitive nudges with curious ones. Instead of "You're behind," it says, "What made this hard today?"

**Behavioral principle:** *Shame elimination via reframing*

---

### Compassion Stopwatch

**n.** A tool that times shame spirals and helps you reduce the trend over time. Compassion Stopwatch tracks how long you spend in guilt/self-blame and gently interrupts: "You've been here for 12 minutes. Let's redirect."

**Behavioral principle:** *Pattern awareness + spiral interruption*

---

### Compound Cue System

**n.** A multi-layer behavior installation method that hits your nervous system from four angles: **environmental cues** (make goals unavoidable), **emotional anchoring** (tie tasks to feelings/consequences), **productive urgency** (create time pressure), and **repetitive exposure** (constant reinforcement until automatic). Example: Your Anchor Task appears on your lock screen, you've defined why it matters, you see the cost of delay, and you get varied reminders every 20 minutes.

**Behavioral principle:** *Multi-vector behavior conditioning*

---

### Context Cache

**n.** An autosave system that captures the key facts, links, and mental state you'll need to pick up a task later without reloading your entire brain. When you pause, Divergify saves: what you were working on, the next step, what you were thinking, and where files live.

**Behavioral principle:** *Cognitive offloading + re-entry friction reduction*

---

### Context Cliff

**n.** The moment when an interruption causes you to lose the thread, and suddenly you're standing in the kitchen holding a stapler with no memory of why. Divergify fights this by leaving context markers — breadcrumbs that help you climb back up.

**Behavioral principle:** *Context-switching cost mitigation*

---

### Context Currency

**n.** The idea that spending time on setup and clarity now saves you exponentially more time later. Five minutes prepping a task (gathering links, writing next actions, eliminating one blocker) earns you back 30 minutes of not staring blankly at your screen.

**Behavioral principle:** *Front-loaded investment vs. recurring friction cost*

---

### Context Passport

**n.** A pre-session checklist that ensures you have everything you need before starting: links, logins, files, tools, and mental clarity. Context Passport prevents the start-stop-search spiral where you sit down to work but spend 20 minutes hunting for passwords.

**Behavioral principle:** *Setup forcing function*

---

## D

### Decision Fatigue Shield

**n.** A system that reduces trivial choices so your executive function can focus on what matters. Decision Fatigue Shield automates, templates, or removes low-stakes decisions: what to wear, what to eat, which task to do first.

**Behavioral principle:** *Decision automation + executive function conservation*

---

### Deep Work Window

**n.** A protected time block reserved for tasks requiring sustained focus, creativity, or problem-solving. Deep Work Window is sacred — no meetings, no admin, no shallow tasks allowed. Divergify identifies when your brain is most capable and guards that time aggressively.

**Behavioral principle:** *Peak performance time protection*

---

### Detour Diary

**n.** A running log of interruptions, distractions, and context switches throughout the day. Detour Diary doesn't shame you — it helps you see patterns. Are you losing focus at the same time every day? Are specific people, apps, or environments consistently derailing you?

**Behavioral principle:** *Pattern recognition through tracking*

---

### Dopamine Deposit

**n.** A small, intentional reward after completing a task — especially one that felt hard or boring. Dopamine Deposit pairs task completion with positive feedback so your brain associates effort with satisfaction instead of dread. Examples: a favorite song, a stretch, a silly animation.

**Behavioral principle:** *Positive reinforcement loop installation*

---

### Doom Scroll Block

**n.** A timed intervention that interrupts infinite scrolling and asks: "Is this what you meant to be doing?" Doom Scroll Block doesn't judge — it just reality-checks. If you consciously choose to keep scrolling, fine. But if you zoned out and lost 40 minutes, it gives you an exit ramp.

**Behavioral principle:** *Awareness interruption + conscious choice restoration*

---

### Drag Timer

**n.** A metric that tracks how long it takes you to actually start a task after deciding to do it. Drag Timer measures the gap between intention and action. High drag = high friction. Once you see the pattern, you can hunt for the source: unclear steps? missing tools? emotional resistance?

**Behavioral principle:** *Initiation friction quantification*

---

## E

### Effort Estimate

**n.** A subjective guess at how much energy a task will actually cost you — not how long it takes, but how hard it feels. Effort Estimate accounts for cognitive load, emotional weight, sensory demands, and novelty. Divergify uses Effort Estimates to match tasks to your current Brain Battery.

**Behavioral principle:** *Perceived difficulty vs. actual duration*

---

### Emergency Eject

**n.** A pre-planned escape route for when a task, situation, or environment becomes unbearable. Emergency Eject is your "get out of jail free" card — permission to stop without shame. It includes: a clear exit script, a safe place to decompress, and a plan for resuming later (or not).

**Behavioral principle:** *Overload prevention + agency restoration*

---

### Energy Audit

**n.** A periodic review of how you're spending physical, cognitive, and emotional resources. Energy Audit asks: What's draining me? What's recharging me? Am I overspending in one area? Divergify prompts Energy Audits weekly and uses the data to adjust task load and suggest recovery strategies.

**Behavioral principle:** *Resource allocation awareness*

---

### Escape Velocity

**n.** The minimum momentum needed to break free from inertia and actually start working. Escape Velocity varies by task, day, and brain state. Sometimes it's 30 seconds of movement. Sometimes it's a 10-minute warm-up task. Divergify helps you identify what your Escape Velocity requirement is right now.

**Behavioral principle:** *Activation energy threshold identification*

---

## F

### Finish Line Fade

**n.** The phenomenon where motivation evaporates right before task completion — you're 95% done, but that last 5% feels impossible. Finish Line Fade happens because your brain has already moved on. Divergify fights this with Almost There Alerts, micro-rewards at 80%, and completion predictions.

**Behavioral principle:** *Late-stage motivation drop intervention*

---

### Friction Hunt

**n.** A deliberate search for obstacles that make starting or continuing unnecessarily hard. Friction Hunt identifies: missing tools, unclear instructions, sensory annoyances, decision points, emotional blocks. Once you spot friction, you can reduce it.

**Behavioral principle:** *Systematic obstacle identification*

---

### Future Anchor

**n.** A task, event, or milestone that gives meaning to current effort. Future Anchor answers: "Why am I doing this boring thing right now?" It connects today's admin to tomorrow's freedom, this week's grind to next month's vacation. Divergify links tasks to their Future Anchors so motivation doesn't vanish mid-effort.

**Behavioral principle:** *Delayed gratification bridge*

---

## G

### Gremlin Mode

**[VISUAL: Mischievous gremlin representing ADHD chaos energy — file: GremlinBrain.png]**

**n.** The chaotic, impulsive, mischievous energy that shows up when your ADHD brain is understimulated or overwhelmed. Gremlin Mode isn't bad — it's your nervous system demanding novelty, play, or chaos. Instead of fighting it, Divergify redirects it: reorganize a drawer violently, delete 47 old emails, doodle something ridiculous. Gremlin Mode gets a voice so you're not at war with your own brain.

**Behavioral principle:** *Impulse redirection vs. suppression*

---

### Grounding Ritual

**n.** A short, repeatable sequence that brings you back to your body when your brain is spinning. Grounding Ritual might include: 5 deep breaths, naming 3 things you can see/touch/hear, splashing cold water on your face, or doing 10 jumping jacks. It interrupts fight-or-flight and resets your nervous system.

**Behavioral principle:** *Parasympathetic activation*

---

### Guilt Guillotine

**n.** A tool that severs the connection between past failure and future effort. Guilt Guillotine says: what happened yesterday doesn't determine what you can do today. You're not behind — you're starting now. Divergify reframes: "You didn't do it then. You can do it now. That's the whole game."

**Behavioral principle:** *Temporal decoupling + learned helplessness reversal*

---

## H

### Habit Buddy

**n.** A low-pressure accountability partner (human or AI) who checks in on recurring goals without judgment. Habit Buddy doesn't nag; it asks, "How'd it go?" and listens. If you missed a day, it helps you troubleshoot instead of shame-spiral.

**Behavioral principle:** *Non-judgmental accountability*

---

### Habit Stack

**n.** A sequence of small actions chained together so completing one triggers the next. Habit Stack reduces decision fatigue and builds momentum. Example: "After I pour coffee, I review my Anchor Task. After I review my Anchor Task, I set a timer."

**Behavioral principle:** *Sequential behavior chaining*

---

### Hard Start

**n.** A strategy where you begin with the most difficult or important task first. Hard Start leverages morning energy and reduces the dread that builds from procrastination. Once the Hard Start is done, everything else feels easier by comparison.

**Behavioral principle:** *Peak energy allocation + avoidance prevention*

---

### Hyperfocus Tunnel

**[VISUAL: Person lost in deep hyperfocus — file: HYPERFOCUS TUNNEL.png]**

**n.** The immersive, time-warping state where you're so absorbed in a task that hours vanish and the world ceases to exist. Hyperfocus Tunnel is incredibly productive but often uncontrollable. Divergify helps you notice when you're in it and gently reminds you to hydrate, move, breathe. It also tracks what triggers Hyperfocus so you can occasionally invoke it intentionally.

**Behavioral principle:** *Flow state awareness + trigger identification*

---

## I

### Ideal Day Blueprint

**n.** A flexible template of what a "good" day looks like for you — not perfection, but alignment. Ideal Day Blueprint includes: when you wake up, what tasks get done, how much rest you take, what makes you feel stable. It's not a rigid schedule; it's a north star.

**Behavioral principle:** *Directional goal-setting vs. rigid scheduling*

---

### Identity Loop

**n.** A linguistic pattern that frames behaviors as identity rather than actions: "I'm someone who exercises" vs. "I should exercise." Identity Loop uses repetitive messaging to install the identity first, making the behavior feel natural. Divergify uses Identity Loop language in notifications and rewards.

**Behavioral principle:** *Identity-based behavior change*

---

### Impulse Redirect

**n.** A strategy for channeling sudden urges into productive (or harmless) outlets instead of derailing your day. Impulse Redirect captures the impulse ("I should reorganize my entire bookshelf right now") and either: schedules it for later, redirects it to a related quick task, or lets you do it if Brain Battery is high.

**Behavioral principle:** *Urge surfing + redirection*

---

### Inbox Siege

**n.** A focused sprint where you aggressively clear email, messages, or notifications in one contained session instead of letting them leak into your entire day. Inbox Siege isn't about achieving zero — it's about reducing the pile enough that it stops screaming at you.

**Behavioral principle:** *Batch processing + containment*

---

### Interruption Log

**n.** A record of every external or internal disruption that broke your focus. Interruption Log tracks: who interrupted, why, how long recovery took, and whether it was urgent. Over time, patterns emerge — and patterns can be addressed.

**Behavioral principle:** *Distraction pattern awareness*

---

## L

### Launch Sequence

**n.** A short, repeatable ritual that signals to your brain: "We're starting now." Launch Sequence might include: clearing your desk, putting on Anchor Music, writing down the first tiny step, or doing 10 push-ups. Once your nervous system recognizes the Launch Sequence, starting becomes easier.

**Behavioral principle:** *Behavioral cue installation*

---

### Loop Closer

**n.** A tool that identifies unfinished tasks creating mental background noise and prompts you to either: complete them, defer them with a plan, or officially abandon them. Loop Closer reduces Taskache by closing psychological open loops.

**Behavioral principle:** *Zeigarnik effect resolution*

---

## M

### Momentum Thief

**n.** Anything that breaks your rhythm and makes restarting feel impossible. Common Momentum Thieves: unclear next actions, missing tools, sensory overload, emotional dysregulation, other people's urgency. Divergify identifies Momentum Thieves and helps you neutralize them.

**Behavioral principle:** *Rhythm disruption identification*

---

### Motivation Mirage

**n.** The false belief that you need to "feel motivated" before you can start. Motivation Mirage keeps you stuck waiting for inspiration that never comes. Divergify flips this: action creates motivation, not the other way around. Start with 2 minutes, and motivation follows.

**Behavioral principle:** *Action-first vs. feeling-first*

---

## N

### Nesting Task

**n.** A small, easy task you complete while waiting for something else (email reply, download, compile, microwave). Nesting Task prevents dead time from becoming Doom Scroll Time. Examples: tidy desk, stretch, review tomorrow's calendar, delete 5 old files.

**Behavioral principle:** *Dead time utilization*

---

### Next Action Clarity

**n.** The practice of defining the single, physical next step for every task — no abstractions, no ambiguity. Instead of "Work on report," Next Action Clarity gives you: "Open report doc and reread intro paragraph." The more specific the next action, the easier it is to start.

**Behavioral principle:** *Concrete action definition*

---

### No Zero Days

**n.** A commitment to do at least one small meaningful action every day, no matter how bad the day is. No Zero Days doesn't demand productivity heroics — it just asks you to prove you're still moving. One action protects your streak and preserves agency.

**Behavioral principle:** *Minimum viable daily progress*

---

## O

### Obstacle Tax

**n.** The hidden cost of every barrier between you and task completion. Obstacle Tax includes: unclear instructions, missing passwords, needing to ask someone a question, sensory discomfort. High Obstacle Tax = low completion rate. Divergify calculates Obstacle Tax for each task and prompts you to reduce it before starting.

**Behavioral principle:** *Friction cost quantification*

---

### Overload Alarm

**n.** A detection system that notices when you're approaching sensory, cognitive, or emotional capacity limits and suggests a break before you crash. Overload Alarm tracks: how long you've been working, how many decisions you've made, environmental stressors, and emotional intensity.

**Behavioral principle:** *Burnout prevention via early warning*

---

## P

### Pause Button Protocol

**n.** A system for cleanly stopping work mid-task without losing your place. Pause Button Protocol captures: what you were doing, what the next step is, and any relevant thoughts. When you resume, you're not starting from scratch.

**Behavioral principle:** *Graceful task exit*

---

### Perfectionism Parachute

**[VISUAL: Parachute catching someone falling from perfectionism — file: PERFECTIONISM PARACHUTE.png]**

**n.** An emergency system that catches you before perfectionism spirals into paralysis. Perfectionism Parachute activates when you've been "working" on something too long without progress. It intervenes with permission statements: "Done is better than perfect," "Shitty first drafts are required," "You can fix it later."

**Behavioral principle:** *Cognitive distortion intervention at perfectionism trap*

---

### Priority Pulse

**n.** A daily or weekly check-in that re-evaluates what actually matters vs. what feels urgent. Priority Pulse asks: If I could only do 3 things this week, what would they be? Everything else is optional noise.

**Behavioral principle:** *Essential vs. urgent filtering*

---

### Procrastiplanning

**[VISUAL: Person surrounded by planning tools instead of doing work — file: PROCRASTIPLANNING.png]**

**n.** The ADHD specialty of spending hours meticulously planning something instead of actually doing it. You tell yourself you're "being productive" because you're making color-coded spreadsheets or reorganizing your task manager for the 47th time — but zero actual work gets done. Divergify calls this out: "You've reorganized this list 3 times today. Pick ONE thing and do it."

**Behavioral principle:** *Meta-work awareness + avoidance flagging*

---

## Q

### Quick Win Stack

**n.** A collection of 2-5 minute tasks you can knock out when Brain Battery is low but you still want forward motion. Quick Win Stack might include: reply to one text, file 3 documents, water a plant, delete 10 old emails. Each win builds micro-momentum.

**Behavioral principle:** *Low-barrier momentum building*

---

## R

### Reality Check Intervention

**n.** A system that catches catastrophic thinking in real-time and tests it against evidence. When your brain says "Everything is falling apart," Reality Check Intervention asks: "Is it really? Let's look at the data." It pulls recent wins, completed tasks, and positive feedback.

**Behavioral principle:** *Evidence-based cognitive reframe*

---

### Recovery Ritual

**n.** A planned sequence of activities designed to restore Brain Battery after intense work or emotional drain. Recovery Ritual might include: walk outside, shower, nap, snack, listen to music, call a friend. The key is planning it in advance so you don't have to decide when you're already depleted.

**Behavioral principle:** *Proactive energy restoration*

---

### Repetition Lock

**n.** A daily messaging system that reinforces target behaviors through consistent, hypnotic language patterns. Repetition Lock sends you the same core message every day at the same time, using identity-based framing: "You're someone who [behavior]. You've done it before. Today's the day you already started." After 21+ days, the behavior starts feeling automatic.

**Behavioral principle:** *Linguistic conditioning through repetition*

---

### Reward Roulette

**n.** A gamification mechanic that delivers dopamine hits at unpredictable intervals. Instead of getting the same "good job!" every time, Reward Roulette mixes it up: sometimes a simple checkmark, sometimes confetti, sometimes a hilarious voice line. The unpredictability keeps your brain engaged.

**Behavioral principle:** *Variable ratio reinforcement schedule*

---

### Rumination Redirect

**n.** A tool that detects when you're stuck in a mental loop (replaying a conversation, worrying about a future event, rehashing a mistake) and offers an exit strategy: physical movement, 5-minute distraction task, or journaling prompt to externalize the thoughts.

**Behavioral principle:** *Thought loop interruption*

---

## S

### Sensory Audit

**n.** A periodic review of environmental inputs that might be draining your Brain Battery without you realizing it. Sensory Audit checks: lighting (too bright/dim?), noise (too loud/chaotic?), temperature, clothing comfort, screen brightness. Small adjustments can have massive impact.

**Behavioral principle:** *Environmental optimization for sensory processing*

---

### Setup Macro

**n.** A pre-built template or checklist that removes decision-making from recurring task setup. Setup Macro might include: opening specific apps, gathering standard links, creating folder structure, loading templates. The less you have to think about setup, the faster you start.

**Behavioral principle:** *Setup automation*

---

### Shame Shield

**n.** A linguistic filter that removes self-blame language from task tracking and feedback. Shame Shield replaces "You failed" with "What made this hard?" and "You're behind" with "Let's adjust the plan." It actively blocks shame-based motivation because shame kills ADHD productivity.

**Behavioral principle:** *Shame elimination via language reframe*

---

### Shutdown Sequence

**n.** A repeatable end-of-day ritual that signals to your brain: "Work is over." Shutdown Sequence might include: closing all tabs, writing tomorrow's top 3 priorities, tidying desk, changing clothes. Without a Shutdown Sequence, work bleeds into rest and rest never feels restorative.

**Behavioral principle:** *Work-rest boundary reinforcement*

---

### Sprint Window

**n.** A focused 15-45 minute block where you do ONE task with no interruptions, no multitasking, no checking your phone. Sprint Window isn't about marathons — it's about concentrated bursts. After the sprint, you get a mandatory break. This prevents burnout and maintains intensity.

**Behavioral principle:** *Timeboxed intensity + forced recovery*

---

### Status Check

**n.** A quick self-assessment prompt that asks: "How's your Brain Battery right now? What do you need?" Status Check prevents you from bulldozing through depletion and crashing later. If Brain Battery is low, Divergify suggests rest or low-effort tasks instead of pushing harder.

**Behavioral principle:** *Self-awareness intervention*

---

### Streak Saver

**n.** A fallback task that keeps your daily streak alive even on disaster days. Streak Saver is the absolute minimum: log one task, drink water, move three things. It's not about productivity — it's about preventing zero days and protecting psychological momentum.

**Behavioral principle:** *Streak preservation via minimum action*

---

## T

### Task Mountain

**[VISUAL: Overwhelming mountain of tasks looming over someone — file: TASK MOUNTAIN.png]**

**n.** The overwhelming, impossible-looking pile of tasks that makes you want to crawl back into bed and declare the day a loss. Task Mountain triggers freeze mode in ADHD brains. Divergify fights Task Mountain with Cascade Method (breaking it into micro-steps), Anchor Task (picking the ONE thing), and Cliffhanger Mechanism (hiding the full mountain).

**Behavioral principle:** *Overwhelm reduction through controlled information exposure*

---

### Taskache

**[VISUAL: Person with head made of sticky notes — file: Taskache.png]**

**n.** The headache-like sensation from having too many tasks bouncing around your brain with nowhere to land. Taskache happens when working memory is overloaded. The cure isn't completing the tasks — it's capturing them out of your head into a trusted system. Once externalized, the Taskache fades even if the work isn't done yet.

**Behavioral principle:** *Cognitive offloading + working memory relief*

---

### Three-Task Thursday

**n.** A weekly forcing function that asks: If you could only finish 3 things this week, what would they be? Three-Task Thursday cuts through urgency noise and forces priority clarity. Everything else is optional.

**Behavioral principle:** *Forced prioritization via constraint*

---

### Time Anchor

**n.** A recurring event that structures your day (morning coffee, lunch, end-of-workday walk). Time Anchors aren't tasks — they're rhythm markers that help ADHD brains track time passage and create predictable structure without rigid scheduling.

**Behavioral principle:** *Temporal structure via recurring events*

---

### Timer Trick

**n.** The practice of setting a timer for an absurdly short duration (2-5 minutes) to bypass resistance. Timer Trick says: "You only have to work until the timer goes off." Usually, starting is the hardest part — once the timer ends, you'll often keep going.

**Behavioral principle:** *Commitment minimization + momentum leverage*

---

### Tin Foil Hat Mode

**n.** Divergify's privacy-first, zero-tracking operating mode. In Tin Foil Hat Mode, all your data stays on YOUR device — no servers, no cloud sync, no analytics, no selling your ADHD patterns to advertisers. Your productivity data is yours alone.

**Behavioral principle:** *Trust through transparency + surveillance anxiety reduction*

---

### Transition Buffer

**n.** A 5-15 minute gap between tasks or meetings that gives your brain time to switch contexts without crashing. Transition Buffer prevents back-to-back scheduling chaos and reduces the Cognitive Drag of rapid context switches.

**Behavioral principle:** *Context-switch recovery time*

---

### Trigger Stack

**n.** A collection of environmental, sensory, or social cues that automatically prompt a specific behavior. Example: "When I sit at my desk + put on headphones + open Divergify, I enter work mode." Trigger Stack reduces the willpower needed to start by relying on conditioned responses.

**Behavioral principle:** *Multi-sensory behavioral cue layering*

---

## U

### Urgency Engineering

**n.** The deliberate creation of productive time pressure to trigger action without real consequences. Urgency Engineering uses artificial deadlines, countdown timers, and cost-of-delay visualizations to activate your brain's urgency response in a controlled way.

**Behavioral principle:** *Controlled stress response activation*

---

## V

### Victory Log

**n.** A running record of completed tasks, progress made, and problems solved. Victory Log isn't about bragging — it's about combating ADHD memory bias, which makes you forget wins and remember only failures. When Bias Bouncer needs evidence, it pulls from Victory Log.

**Behavioral principle:** *Positive evidence accumulation*

---

## W

### Warm-Up Task

**n.** A simple, low-stakes task you do before tackling hard work. Warm-Up Task might be: organize desk, review yesterday's notes, reply to one easy email. It builds momentum and signals to your brain that "work mode" has started.

**Behavioral principle:** *Activation energy reduction via easy entry point*

---

### Willpower Budget

**n.** The recognition that willpower is finite and depletes throughout the day. Willpower Budget helps you allocate decision-making and hard tasks to high-capacity windows and protect low-capacity times with automated routines or easy tasks.

**Behavioral principle:** *Ego depletion awareness*

## X

### X-Factor Task

**n.** The one unexpected variable that could derail your entire day if you don't account for it. X-Factor Task might be: a meeting that always runs over, a person who always interrupts, a task that always takes 3x longer than planned. Divergify helps you identify X-Factors and build buffers around them.

**Behavioral principle:** *Risk awareness + contingency planning*

## Z

### Zero Day Prevention

**n.** A system designed to prevent days where you complete literally nothing and spiral into shame. Zero Day Prevention asks for one micro-action, no matter how small: drink water, reply to one text, move three things. The bar is set so low that refusal would be absurd.

**Behavioral principle:** *Minimum viable action to preserve agency*

### Zone Defense

**n.** A strategy for protecting Deep Work Windows from external interruptions. Zone Defense might include: phone in another room, "Do Not Disturb" sign, auto-reply messages, blocking distracting websites. The goal is to create an environment where focus is the default, not a constant battle.

**Behavioral principle:** *Environmental distraction elimination*
