## Adaptive Afterburn

Adaptive Afterburn refers to that exhilarating burst of creative output that often emerges right after a deadline or high-pressure period has passed, when your neurodivergent brain is still humming in high gear but without the external constraints. It's like your mind's way of capitalizing on residual momentum, turning what could be downtime into a productive frenzy. This phenomenon highlights the superpower of neurodivergent thinking, where traditional "off" switches don't apply, allowing for innovative ideas to flow freely once the initial stress dissipates. Embrace it by scheduling light buffer time post-deadline to capture these sparks without burnout. It's a reminder that our brains thrive on adaptive rhythms, not rigid schedules.

## ADHD Atlas

The ADHD Atlas is your internal navigation system, expertly mapping the quickest paths from sudden inspiration to tangible action, even amidst the most chaotic mental landscapes. Unlike a standard GPS that follows straight lines, this atlas thrives on detours, shortcuts, and scenic routes, helping you navigate executive function challenges with intuitive flair. It's powered by hyperfocus bursts and pattern recognition, turning potential overwhelm into strategic wins. For neurodivergents, it's essential to calibrate this atlas with tools like visual cues or habit nudges, ensuring you reach your destination without getting lost in the fog of distractions. Ultimately, it's a testament to how our brains are wired for dynamic exploration, making us natural innovators in a linear world.

## Anchor Task

An Anchor Task serves as the foundational, non-negotiable activity that grounds your entire day, preventing other tasks from drifting into chaos like untethered balloons. By prioritizing this one key action—whether it's a morning ritual, a critical work deliverable, or self-care routine—you create a stable base that stabilizes everything else. For neurodivergent individuals, this technique combats decision fatigue and scattered energy, using the anchor's weight to pull focus back when distractions pull you away. Implement it by choosing something aligned with your energy peaks, and watch how it fosters a sense of accomplishment that ripples outward. It's a privacy-first strategy to build habits that honor your unique brain wiring.

## Attention Altitude

Attention Altitude describes the mental elevation you achieve by zooming out for broader context before diving deep into focused details, much like adjusting your vantage point from a mountain peak to ground level. This shift helps neurodivergents manage information overload by first surveying the big picture, then zeroing in without losing sight of the whole. It's particularly useful for tasks involving complexity, where getting stuck in minutiae can lead to frustration. Practice by using tools like mind maps to elevate your view, then apply targeted focus. This approach turns potential overwhelm into empowered clarity, celebrating the adaptive flexibility of neurodivergent cognition.

## Brain Bounce

Brain Bounce is the lively, energetic leapfrog between ideas that keeps projects dynamic and wards off the stagnation that can plague more linear thinkers. For those with neurodivergent brains, this isn't scattered thinking but a vital process of cross-pollination, where one concept sparks another in rapid succession. It fuels innovation but requires gentle corralling to channel into productivity—think timed sessions or note captures to harness the bounce without exhaustion. Embrace it as a superpower that injects vitality into routines, turning what others see as distraction into a fountain of creativity. With practice, Brain Bounce becomes a controlled rhythm that propels you forward.
