    <h1>Welcome to Divergify: The Revolution for Chaos-Brained Geniuses Has Officially Begun</h1>
    <p>I’m just going to say it straight: the world was not built for neurodivergent people. Not for the innovators whose minds light up like constellations. Not for the ones who solve problems sideways, diagonally, and in spirals. Definitely not for the people with 84 browser tabs open and absolutely no intention of closing a single one.</p>
    <p>So we built Divergify for the chaos-brained geniuses who push humanity forward while everyone else is still buffering.</p>
  </section>
</header>
<main>
  <section>
    <p>Divergify isn’t a productivity app. It’s a movement. A rebellion. A new operating system for the next evolution of brains. We’re here to bridge the gap between how your mind works and how the world expects you to operate—with more swagger, science, and soul than anyone else dares to try.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Why Divergify Exists</h2>
    <p>Traditional productivity tools feel like they were coded by people who have never once lost their keys while holding them or wandered into a room and forgot their entire existence. We wanted something that harnesses your wiring, not fights it. Divergify was born from a single truth: your neurodivergent brain is not broken. The world’s outdated software is. Until society catches up, we’re building the tools that help you thrive right now.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>The Divergify Philosophy: Neurodivergence Is the Next Evolution</h2>
    <p>We don’t tiptoe around neurodivergence as if it’s a medical footnote—we celebrate it as the superpower it is. Your brain is a high-speed, multidimensional, pattern-detecting, intuitive machine. You see connections others miss. You innovate without trying. You feel deeply, imagine vividly, and solve creatively. That’s not a disadvantage. That’s a future advantage. Our mission is to help you wield that power without burning out or getting buried under life admin that looks easy for everyone else.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>The Science Behind the Movement</h2>
    <p>We built Divergify using solid behavioral science, weaving in habit-building strategies that actually stick to neurodivergent brains instead of sliding off them like a fried egg on a non-stick pan. This isn’t therapy. Not treatment. Not a cure. This is tactical self-brainwashing designed to help you:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Stick to habits without white-knuckling.</li>
      <li>Organize your life without losing your spark.</li>
      <li>Get things done without sacrificing the creativity that makes you unstoppable.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We’re not here to tame you—we’re here to equip you.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>The Tools That Make Divergify Different</h2>
    <div class="callout">
      <p><strong>The Integrated Calendar That Doesn’t Judge You:</strong> Plan your day visually and intuitively, synced to your energy rhythms—not some imaginary hustle clock.</p>
      <p><strong>Map Integration for People Who Can’t Handle Another Wrong Turn:</strong> Overlay tasks with travel routes so you stop wasting energy on logistics and save it for brilliance.</p>
      <p><strong>Shopping List Mode:</strong> Keeps you laser-focused so you actually leave the store with tomatoes instead of another Himalayan salt lamp.</p>
      <p><strong>Beat your baseline Blocker:</strong> Instead of punishing you for losing focus, it challenges you to beat your past performance and gamifies your dopamine hunger.</p>
      <p><strong>The Gentle Nudge Assistant:</strong> Encouraging reminders that feel like a supportive friend tapping your shoulder, never a judgmental manager breathing down your neck.</p>
    </div>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Our Vision: A World That Finally Gets Us</h2>
    <p>We’re not building an app—we’re building a revolution. A world where neurodivergent people aren’t gaslit into thinking they’re “too much,” “too messy,” or “too scattered.” A world that recognizes the brilliance behind the chaos. Divergify is becoming the home base for every out-of-the-box thinker who’s ever felt like a glitch in the system. You’re not a glitch. You’re the upgrade.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Where We’re Going Next</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Full sensory-friendly interfaces.</li>
      <li>AI-supported routine builders that match neurodivergent energy cycles.</li>
      <li>Community spaces for chaos-brains to collaborate instead of isolate.</li>
      <li>More behavioral science tools to turn habits into second nature.</li>
      <li>Extensions into school, workplace, and accessibility systems.</li>
      <li>A global movement that forces society to evolve with us instead of around us.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This isn’t a startup. It’s a rebellion disguised as software. And you’re part of it.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>A Final Note From the Future</h2>
    <p>If you’re reading this, it means you’re tired of forcing your brain into boxes that never fit. You’re ready for tools built for people who think in constellations, not checklists. Divergify gives you structure without sabotage, habits without shame, and focus without losing the spark that makes you powerful.</p>
    <p>Your brain isn’t the problem. The system is. We’re here to rewrite it.</p>
