            Tinfoil Hat blocks cloud assist calls and hides embed-style content. It is a product-level privacy control,
            not a claim of full operating-system or network-level blocking.

          <p className="p">
            The Brain Dump screen includes an optional microphone button. If you tap it, the Android or iOS app
            uses your device's speech recognition service; the web version uses speech recognition supplied by
            your browser when available. Depending on your device, speech may be processed by that service, not
            by Divergify. Voice capture only starts after you tap the microphone. You can use Brain Dump entirely
            by typing if you prefer.

            The Android build declares internet and microphone permissions. Microphone access is requested at
            runtime only when you use voice input in Brain Dump. This build does not declare camera or location
            permission.
